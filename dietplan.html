                            <p>The Atkins diet is based on the theory that eating carbohydrates stimulates the
                                production of insulin, which in turn leads to hunger, eating, and weight gain. The
                                theory is that people on the Atkins diet experience reduced appetite and their bodies
                                use stored fat for energy versus burning glucose from ingested carbohydrate. Burning fat
                                for energy is supposedly lead to weight loss.<BR>

                            <p>The paleo diet is a nutritional approach that focuses on eating only foods that are high
                                in nutrients, unprocessed, and based on the foods that were available and eaten by
                                humans in Paleolithic times. The main idea behind the paleo diet is that if humans were
                                not able to consume a food thousands of years ago- before industrial agriculture, the
                                domestication of animals, and modern food processing existed- than humans should not
                                consume these types of foods today, because the human body is not adapted to them.</p>
