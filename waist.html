                                <li>Using a non-elastic measuring tape, wrap the tape around your
                                    abdomen at the smallest point at or near the navel (belly button).</li>
                                <li>Pull the tape tight enough to keep it in position, but not so tight as to
                                    create an indentation in the skin.</li>
                                <li>If you do not have a large enough measuring tape, use a piece of string
                                    and measure the length of the string with a ruler.</li>

                            risk by losing just 5-10% of your body weight! Here are a few tips to
                            get started:</P>
                        <UL>
                            <li> Start an exercise plan. It can be as simple as investing in a
                                pedometer and setting a goal number of steps each day. Aim to build
                                up to at least 5,000 steps per day and you’ll be well on your way to
                                improve your health</li>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <li> To effectively lose weight (and keep it off!), you need to make changes
                        to the way you eat. Start with a self-evaluation. What are one or two easy and doable changes
                        that you could make (and stick with) to
                        decrease the number of calories in your day? For example, a switch
                        to 2% from whole milk, or forgoing the mayonnaise on your sandwich
                        could get you off to a great start.</li>
                    <li> Ask yourself how ready you are to make these changes, and how
                        confident you are that you will be successful? Then, set up a plan to
                        push forward. If you need help to get started, consider talking with your
                        health care provider or a health coach.</li>
