                <h2>What is depression?</h2>
                <p>Major depression is different than “the blues,” and it certainly is not a
                    sign of weakness. The exact cause is unknown, but it is most likely caused by
                    a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<br>
                    Common symptoms of depression include:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Intense feelings of sadness</li>
                        <li> Loss of interest in usual activities</li>
                        <li> Feelings of guilt or hopelessness</li>
                        <li>Loss of energy</li>
                        <li>Poor concentration</li>
                        <li>Increased or decreased appetite</li>
                        <li>Moving more quickly or slowly than normal</li>
                        <li>Loss of self-esteem</li>
                        <li>Difficulty falling or staying asleep or sleeping too much</li>
                        <li>Thoughts of death or wanting to hurt yourself</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If you think that you are experiencing depression, it is important that
                    you visit your health care provider as soon as possible. In order to make a
                    diagnosis, he/she may:</p>
                <h2>HOW IS DEPRESSION TREATED?</h2>
                <p>If you are diagnosed with depression, one or more of the following modes
                    of treatment may be recommended:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>medication</strong>—Several types of antidepressant medications are
                            available. Only your health care provider can determine which
                            medications, if any, are right for you. It is important to take these as
                            directed, report any side effects, and do not take medication prescribed
                            for another person. </li>
                        <li><strong>counseling</strong>—Research has shown that psychotherapy
                            is a key component in the treatment of depression and often works
                            better when combined with medication therapy. </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>excercise</strong>—Did you know that several studies have shown that exercise is
                        often more effective than medication in treating depression? This is helpful
                        for depression because it stimulates the release of brain chemicals that
                        improve your mood. While your doctor may also prescribe medications,
                        committing to an activity program will kick start your recovery</li>
                    <li><strong>other forms of treatment</strong> such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT),
                        transcranial nerve stimulation (TNS), complementary and alternative
                        treatments may be helpful for certain cases. This would be determined
                        by your mental health specialist. </li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>SELF-CARE WHEN YOU ARE DEPRESSED</h2>
            <P> An important part of overcoming depression is to take good care of yourself
                mentally AND physically:
                <ul>
                    <li>Set realistic goals for yourself.</li>
                    <li> Break large tasks up into smaller ones.</li>
                    <li>Try to spend time with others. Avoid isolation.</li>
                    <li>Talk about your feelings with a loved one.</li>
                    <li>Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole
                        grains, and water. Avoid junk food in excess.</li>
                    <li>Begin and maintain a regular exercise program.</li>
                    </ul>
